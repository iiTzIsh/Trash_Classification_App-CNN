## üß† Model Overview
The app uses a **MobileNetV2 CNN model** fine-tuned with **transfer learning** for high performance. Key techniques include:
1. **Transfer Learning:** Pretrained on ImageNet and fine-tuned for trash classification.
2. **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, flipping, and zooming to improve robustness.
3. **Batch Normalization and Dropout:** Enhances model stability and prevents overfitting.
4. **Learning Rate Scheduling:** Dynamically adjusts learning rate for better convergence.

**Specifications:**
- **Input Shape:** `(224, 224, 3)`  
- **Output Classes:** `Cardboard`, `Glass`, `Metal`, `Paper`, `Plastic`, `Trash`  
- **Frameworks Used:** TensorFlow/Keras and Streamlit  

**Performance:** Achieved ~95% validation accuracy with early stopping.
